1) a function is a collection of commands to perform a task by using the commands repeatedly,to perform a given task the need for
 using function in every language is that it returns more than one value an d can update the calling variable without modifying the whole code.  

2)In both the function addpositive and subtractpositive functions have less degree of coupling
  hence better modularity and both the functions are reusable.the functions are reusable as we only assign the task of doing some 
  thing to the function so while coding we can call the same function but assign different values to it.

3)data can be send to function by calling that function and get the data back when that function 
  returns the value to the caller.
