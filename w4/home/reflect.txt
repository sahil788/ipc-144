1)Arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements,
   as the highest no of entries which are to be done are 10 so there should be enough space to hold the values.

2)The advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays are
 we can compare two different types of arrays and more than one value by using matchoing arrays.
but we cannot compare the array declared with int with the array declared with char data type.

3)  The at home part of workshop was just right as we had to only add some things in the in lab part and use do while with multiple selection iteration.
