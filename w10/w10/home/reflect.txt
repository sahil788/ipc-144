1) the difference between string an array of chars is that sting includes a null terminator while array of char does not.

2) scanf("%10[^\n]",&val);

3)It returns 0 as both the addresses of string match.

4) It will need 7 bytes as to accomodate null terminator.

5)The most important thing i learned this semester was to develop logic of code
  and how to format the code using style guidelines.

6)Yes the quizes pushed me to read the topics and helped me to understand well when the topic was taught.

7)The course was delivered in a good manner as we read the topics beforehand due to 
   the quizes

8)No there are no such things.

9)No the deliveration of course was perfect.

10) a. Very good

11) Yes, i enjoyed them as it pushed me to think in diffrent ways of coding and open

12)yes the LabA activities were very interesting.
