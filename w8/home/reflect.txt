1)when passing the array with bracket it is passed by value
Ex  fun(ARRAY[]);
When passing array without bracket it is passed by address
Ex   fun(ARRAY);

2)When an array is passed by address ,the function can not know the size of array so we pass an additional int parameter size that helps the function to know 
the size of array ,in this workshop we have done this by passing an additional parameterint size in the function.

3)when we mention const for array parameters it value remaains const as we pass the array parameters by address,whereas when we don't mention const it value changes as 
it is passed by value
