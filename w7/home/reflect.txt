1)the advantage of using passing values from function using parameters is when local variable is changed is changes the 
otput of varuable instantaly but in retuen type it does not change.

2)derefrencing means the "contents of" what its pointing to
eg in code(
void decompose(long long const phoneNum, int *areacode, int *prefix, int *lineNum)

{
	
*areacode = phoneNum / 10000000;
	
*prefix = (phoneNum % 10000000) / 10000;
	
*lineNum = (phoneNum % 1000000) % 10000;

}
decompose(phoneNumber[i], &areacode, &prefix, &lineNum);
)

3)contents of what the pointer is pointing to in memory
for eg(int sum =52
       int *value 
        value=&sum) it indirecty points to the value stored in addres of sum.
